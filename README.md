This repo is for the practice and contains my solutions to the exercises in the EPFL CH-457 'AI for Chemistry' course, based on materials from schwallergroup/ai4chem_course.

The original course notebooks are from [schwallergroup/ai4chem_course](https://github.com/schwallergroup/ai4chem_course) by Schwaller Group (LIAC), EPFL.
I solved the assignments and share my solutions here.
